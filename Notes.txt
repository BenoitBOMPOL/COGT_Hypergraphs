====================
next lines semi visibles or invisible. We should chose only one option
proof of claims 1b -> what does that acomplish ? maybe we need to put it aside
maybe give a sens of direction. Why are we proving a results ? Explain our goal

Idea Write Sets definition on the board ?
Idea justify the proofs to give an idea how proofs in this paper work (a lot of cases and complicated sets)
stopping criterai kinda == 'T+ and T- have been emptied out'
====================
Table of contents : pas assez detaillÃ© / pas fini
slide 3: make a box for side note ?
slide 4: print the edge as set {A, B, C} {A, B, C, D} ? 
slide 5: draw circle around X
slide 7: draw circle around X
slide 9: do we need to define lambda(H) ? Yes
add k-hyperedge connectivity definition ? for symetrie with the previous defi on graphs
point 4 and 5 should merge ?

Proposition: Make 3 definitions on slide 9
an extention of 2 known def to hypergraphs:
1. define k-hyperedge connectivity 
2. k-hyperarc connectivity
A new def for our main result:
3. define (k,k)-partition connected

slide 11: write A = r ?
explicite the sets of vertices ? at least write T+, T-, D+, D- ... ?
check for stopping criteria
explicite R
goto (2.) in 2 step, do not higlight two point on the same slide
explicitely write s and t ( A = s, F = t)
explicite the stopping criteria
no bold step 5 (position is not consistent)

slide 12: Should we define R ?
slide 13: print k or k+1 next to the arrows ?
print T or D or M next to the circle
why T then D then T again ?

slide 14: first point of proof lack context i guess
typo last point '=' should replace ','

slide 15: proof lemma10, point 2 lack information (but is it ok anyway?)
no definition of safe source

slide 16: print '>= k+1' next to the arrows ?

slide 17: consitent position for lemma 13
slide 19: animation normal then with a / then same for b ?
slide 20: not the same as side 12 but maybe it should ?
point 3 M': *An* inclusion...
What does Point 3 means ?
